# My Code for RLAI by RichardS
My attempt for the code in book: [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) in Python.
Show respect to [Zhang Shangtong](https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction) who wrote a python version of code.
